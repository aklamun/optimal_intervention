# Optimal_Intervention
Code from paper [Optimal Intervention in Economic Networks using Influence Maximization Methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01800)

Presented at NetSci Conference 2020, talk available [here](https://youtu.be/MdzoTJz3xEg)

Code files are described as follows:
- GJ_cascade_dense.py = cascade model and intervention approximation algorithms
- wiot_network.py = parses WIOD data and constructs graph objects
- simulate_shocks.py = functionality to set up and run shock simulations
- interpret_data.py = functionality to calculate tail value at risk for simulations
- run_simulation.py = run simulations and generate figures

World Input Output Database (WIOD) data is available [here](http://www.wiod.org/home)
